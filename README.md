# Meerkats -- Event-planning Simplified for Friends

This app solves the issue of clutter in event-planning among friends. Premised on that users would like to create, share, and update their attendance quickly within their social circles, it helps organizers keep the event at the center of their event-planning.

This code creates the server side of the app. This back-end server is built with Node.js, express, and Postgres. It employs some of the best practices of web-development such as JWT, unit-testing, and integration-testing. The database is already seeded with some sample data as seen in the seeds folder.  

In order to take a closer peek at how the application works, you can login to the live site:

Developers who want to contribute to this project, you can clone the code and add new features such as creating groups from friends, creating an admin account, and more. I have already left some breadcrumbs: you can see that friends and user endpoints  is up and running. Code along and send me a merge request. Let's build a clean and efficient events planning to give a chance to our users to enjoy their friends!
